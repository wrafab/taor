<p></p>I am a junior from <a href="http://www.wra.net/">Western Reserve Academy</a>, which is located at a distant town in the middle of nowhere called Hudson.
<br>
This year our school offered a <a href+"http://fab.wra.net/">half year course focusing on digital engineering</a>. We are trying to use the machines we have to create our own personalized items. <br>
The schedule includes Computer Aided Design, Photoshop. 3D Printing, Molding, Casting, Welding, etc.<br>
This website will serve as a presentation of what we are doing each week.
